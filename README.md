# Jigsaw Puzzle

Simple jigsaw puzzle game (currently very rudimental)

## What it already can

* It recognizes when all tiles are put to the right cell
* Easy to configure for any grid size
* Works with any screen width (though changing the screen width mid-game
  is buggy)

## Whatâ€™s to be done next

* Use pictures instead of text for the the tiles
